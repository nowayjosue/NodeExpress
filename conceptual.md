### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What is a JWT?

JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims are typically used to identify the user and can contain information such as user roles, permissions, and expiration time.

- What is the signature portion of the JWT?  What does it do?

The signature is one of the three parts of a JWT (along with the header and payload). It is created by encoding the header, payload, and a secret key with a specified algorithm. The signature ensures the integrity of the JWT; if the data is tampered with, the signature will not match, indicating that the token is invalid.

- If a JWT is intercepted, can the attacker see what's inside the payload?

Yes, JWTs are encoded, not encrypted. If intercepted, the attacker can decode the base64-encoded payload and view its contents. Therefore, sensitive information should not be stored in the payload.

- How can you implement authentication with a JWT?  Describe how it works at a high level.

Authentication with JWT involves issuing a token upon successful login. The token is then sent with each subsequent request to identify the user. The server verifies the token's integrity using the secret key and extracts user information from the payload. This allows for stateless authentication, as the server can trust the token without needing to store session information.

- Compare and contrast unit, integration and end-to-end tests.

Unit tests focus on testing individual components or functions in isolation. Integration tests check how different components work together, testing the interfaces between them. End-to-end tests simulate real user scenarios, testing the entire system from start to finish. Unit tests are fast and isolated, integration tests ensure components work together correctly, and end-to-end tests validate the entire system's functionality.

- What is a mock? What are some things you would mock?

A mock is a simulated object or function used in testing to replace real components. It allows testing the behavior of the system in isolation. Common things to mock include external services (API calls), database queries, or functions that have complex dependencies.

- What is continuous integration?

Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and integrated into the shared repository multiple times a day. The goal is to detect and address integration issues early in the development process.

- What is an environment variable and what are they used for?

An environment variable is a dynamic-named value that can affect the way running processes behave on a computer. They are used to store configuration settings, sensitive information (like API keys or database credentials), and other parameters that might vary between environments (development, testing, production).

- What is TDD? What are some benefits and drawbacks?

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code. Benefits include improved code quality, early bug detection, and a clear specification of requirements. Drawbacks can include the time required to write tests and potential resistance to changing the development process.

- What is the value of using JSONSchema for validation?

JSONSchema is a standard for describing the structure of JSON data. It provides a way to validate the structure of JSON objects, ensuring they meet specific criteria. This is valuable for maintaining data consistency, defining API contracts, and validating inputs/outputs in a standardized way.

- What are some ways to decide which code to test?

Code that contains business logic, critical algorithms, or complex functionality should be tested. Prioritize testing code that handles user input, external dependencies, or components prone to changes. Additionally, focus on testing code that, if it fails, could lead to critical issues or compromise the system's integrity.

- What does `RETURNING` do in SQL? When would you use it?

RETURNING is a clause in SQL used with DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements to return values from rows that were affected by the operation (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, `DELETE). It is useful when you need to retrieve specific values generated by the database (e.g., auto-incremented IDs) after an operation.

- What are some differences between Web Sockets and HTTP?

Web Sockets provide full-duplex communication channels over a single, long-lived connection, enabling real-time data transfer. In contrast, HTTP is a request-response protocol, and each request establishes a new connection. Web Sockets are suitable for applications requiring low latency, real-time updates, and bi-directional communication.

- Did you prefer using Flask over Express? Why or why not (there is no right
  answer here --- we want to see how you think about technology)?

  This question is subjective, and the preference depends on personal experience and project requirements. A candidate might prefer Flask for its simplicity and flexibility in small projects, while Express could be favored for larger projects with a more extensive ecosystem and robust middleware support. It's essential to provide reasoning based on specific use cases and preferences.
